        <h1>Why R.F. Kuang?</h1>
        <div id="fav-author">
            <div>
                <h2>Favourite Author</h2>
                <p>
                    R.F. Kuang is easily my favorite author because her books are not only exciting to read but
                    also based on real historical events with a unique fantasy twist, ranging from a small hint of
                    magical realism to intricate magic systems. She creates powerful stories with deep themes about war,
                    history, and society, making her books both entertaining and thought-provoking, due to the nature of
                    not knowing which side you should be on at times. Her characters feel real, and her storytelling
                    manages to keep me hooked from start to finish. R.F. Kuang’s ability to blend history with fantasy in
                    such a meaningful way is stands out to me and her educational background is one I look up to.

                    <h2>Cultural Impact</h2>
                    <p>
                        R.F. Kuang’s books are culturally significant because they shine a light on important historical
                        events and themes that are often overlooked in mainstream fantasy. By drawing from real-world history,
                        particularly Chinese history and colonialism, she challenges readers to think critically about power,
                        oppression, and identity. At times, she manages to make readers question their own morality and whether
                        the narrator, in this case our main character, is reliable. Her stories give a voice to perspectives
                        that are rarely explored in Western literature, making them both educational and deeply impactful
                        which to me personally, is an important characteristic in a book. Through her work, R.F. Kuang sparks
                        important conversations about history, representation, and the lasting effects of imperialism, ensuring her books
                        resonate with a wide and diverse audience.
